        <h1>If you want our advice to help you get started</h1>
        <p>
            Starting your journey in coding and game development can be exciting
            and a bit overwhelming. Here are our <strong>Top 5 Tips</strong> to
            help you get started and keep you motivated as you learn!
        </p>

        <h2>1. Start with the Basics</h2>
        <p>
            Begin with a coding language that’s beginner-friendly, like
            <strong>Python</strong> or <strong>JavaScript</strong>. These
            languages are not only easier to learn but also have many resources
            and communities to help beginners.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Break Down Your Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Set small, achievable goals. For example, start by learning to
            create simple programs, then gradually move to making a small game.
            This approach will help you build confidence and keep you motivated.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Use Game Development Platforms</h2>
        <p>
            Consider platforms like <strong>Unity</strong> (using C#) or
            <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> (using C++). Unity is particularly
            popular among beginners, as it has a large community, plenty of
            tutorials, and supports both 2D and 3D game development.
        </p>

        <div class="tips">
            <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
            <p>
                Start with 2D games before moving to 3D. 2D games are generally
                easier to make and understand, allowing you to focus on coding
                and game logic without worrying about complex visuals.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>4.. Join a Community</h2>
        <p>
            There are many online communities for developers and game creators,
            like <strong>Reddit</strong>’s game dev forums,
            <strong>Stack Overflow</strong>, and <strong>GitHub</strong>.
            Engaging with these communities can provide support, inspiration,
            and feedback on your projects.
        </p>

        <h2>5.. Don’t Be Afraid to Fail</h2>
        <p>
            Mistakes are part of the learning process. Each error you encounter
            will help you understand coding and development better. Debugging
            your code is one of the best ways to learn!
        </p>
